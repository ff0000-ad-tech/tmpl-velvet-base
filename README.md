### FAT Framework

FF0000-Ad-Tech is a lightweight, capable Javascript-based framework for instantiating, styling, and animating elements. For more information, check [@ff0000-ad-tech/ad-docs](https://github.com/ff0000-ad-tech/ad-docs/blob/master/README.md).

### Velvet

The Velvet Platform is a licensable, web-based, CMP living at https://www.velvet.tech/. It manages data which is then requested & consumed by ad units, depending on their placement / schedule / target. 

The front end of the data is managed with the [@ff0000-ad-tech/ad-velvet](https://github.com/ff0000-ad-tech/ad-velvet/blob/master/README.md) API which is integrated into this template.
