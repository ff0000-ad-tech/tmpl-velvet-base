### Intro 

Build ad banners with ES6 & Greensock animations, leveraging the FF0000-ad-tech library with Velvet integration. For a detailed walk through, including install, development and authoring, see [tmpl-standard-base](https://github.com/ff0000-ad-tech/tmpl-standard-base/) as this template is a variation of that.

### FAT Framework

FF0000-Ad-Tech is a lightweight, capable Javascript-based framework for instantiating, styling, and animating elements. [About FAT](https://github.com/ff0000-ad-tech/tmpl-standard-base/blob/master/README.md)

### Velvet

The Velvet Platform is a licensable, web-based, CMP living at https://www.velvet.tech/. It manages data which is then requested & consumed by ad units, depending on their placement / schedule / target. The front end of the data is managed with the [ad-velvet](https://github.com/ff0000-ad-tech/ad-velvet/blob/master/README.md) API which is integrated into this template.
